A web demo of the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), entered via keyboard or mouse clicks on an SVG.

The project was built with jQuery, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Reflection
This was a simple, quick project. The most time-consuming bit was designing the SVG for the controller. That, and organizing its different layers into useful ids/classes. The goal was to experiment with different ways to interact with complex SVGs and to brush up on jQuery.
